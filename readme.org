* Computing
** Programming Languages
*** Rust - A much beloved systems programming langauge focusing on safety (and wonderful error messages).
**** [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/][The Book]] - An introduction to Rust
**** [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings][Rustlings]] - Rust through small exercises
**** [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/][The Rustonomicon]]  - Peeking underneath the hood.
**** [[https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/][Rust with too many linked lists]]  - Basic and advanced Rust illustrated through linked lists.

*** Zig - A simple, ergonomic systems programming language which integrates with C, Objective-C and C++. Zig also has a built-in package manager and a build system.
**** [[https://ziglang.org/learn/overview/][The Zig Tutorial]]
**** [[https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings][Ziglings]] - Zig through small exercises (like Rustlings).

*** Nim - A statitcally typed, compiled, systems programming language
**** [[https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut1.html][The Official Nim Tutorial]]

** Tools
*** Version Control
**** [[https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/][Git from the bottom up]] - A brief look at git internals
**** [[https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/][Building Git]] - James Coglan highly regarded book which develops a git clone.
Well not literally ~git clone git@github.com:git/git.git~.
**** [[https://pijul.org/][Pijul]] - Pijul claims to be based on a sound theory of patches
Pijul is apparently inspired by a result from [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3903][category theory]].

* Graphics
** Visualization
